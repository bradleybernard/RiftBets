# RiftBets
A JSON RESTful API carried over from a previous version of this project with an HTML frontend powered by Vue.js 2. Automated bet grading with email notifications. Live updates while watching the games so you never have to leave the page to see your bet result. We are using the Laravel framework v5.3 (PHP 7.0) with MySQL 5.7 for most of our data and Redis 3.0, an in-memory database, for our leaderboards.
